Start your Reason learning journey here! A few pointers:

- Many sections have a "Tip & Tricks" and "Design Decisions" section. These are optional reads; feel free to skip them, but do come around and learn the extra tidbits!
- If you need to bind to an existing JS library, [BuckleScript's FFI](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/interop-overview.html) is your friend.
- If you ever feel stuck, ask a question in [our community](/community) and/or submit a pull request by clicking the "Suggest an edit" button on the right.

Enjoy!
